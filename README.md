# UNIFI-PSID-Demo

The following repository provides a demo for the Julia Package PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl (PSID).

The first case showcase the small signal capabilities available in PSID to allow exploration of small signal instabilities and parameter retuning.

The second case runs a large system based on the Reduced WECC 240 Bus system with Grid-Forming Inverter capabilities.
